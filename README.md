# Gridworkz

Gridworkz is a fabless chip company with a team of one: founder Dave Cook, working with AI agents, building open hardware for AI research. This repository holds the **[gridworkz.com](https://gridworkz.com) website and its documentation**.

## Where the hardware lives

The hardware and software are in three repositories under **[github.com/kubeworkz](https://github.com/kubeworkz)**:

| Repository | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **[grx930](https://github.com/kubeworkz/grx930)** | RISC-V SoC: 4 × RV64IMAC cores, 2 × 8×8 systolic NPUs (INT4 to BF16), coherent L2, AXI4 fabric | Verified in simulation; timing closed on Artix-7 at ~121 MHz; GF180MCU test chip in progress |
| **[grxgpu](https://github.com/kubeworkz/grxgpu)** | G100: open RISC-V GPU on Vortex with tensor cores, DXA, ray tracing and graphics, plus the photonic tensor accelerator (PTA) design proposals | Simulation; discovery configuration under review |
| **[grxcp](https://github.com/kubeworkz/grxcp)** | GRXCP: CUDA-style runtime, `grxcc` compiler, grxBLAS and tools for the G100 and GRX930 | In active development |

### Try it in a minute

```bash
sudo apt install iverilog
git clone https://github.com/kubeworkz/grx930.git
cd grx930/c930
make npu
